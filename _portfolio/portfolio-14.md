üõ°Ô∏è Official repository of the paper *Explainability Driven Adversarial Robustness Assessment for Generalized Deepfake-Detectors*.
We propose a framework to perform explainaility-driven adversarial attacks on generalized deepfake detectors and to evaluate their security and robustness under different attack scenarios.
