 I am the ***Organizer*** of the Robust and Real-World Multimedia Forensics: Challenges, Limits, and Emerging Solutions special session.

 The rapid advancements of generative multimodal, processing, and dissemination technologies have enabled the creation of an unprecedented amount of realistic synthetic media, spanning across different modalities. As a result, methods for assessing the integrity and authenticity of digital media play an increasingly crucial role across scientific, industrial, and societal contexts, as the realism of altered digital content continues to challenge forensic models.
 This special session aims to gather interdisciplinary contributions that advance the foundations and practice of robust and trustworthy multimedia forensics across all modalities such as images, text and audio, encouraging research that challenges existing assumptions and proposes forward-looking solutions across the full spectrum of multimedia analysis
